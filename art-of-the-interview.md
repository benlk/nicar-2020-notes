Lee Zurik's 10 timps:

1. Be quiiet. Shut up and wait. Make it awkward. Weaponize the awkwardness of silence to let them talk.
2. Ask questions again. Especially when on camera. You may need to be "frightfully rude."
6. No good conversation starts with a list of questions. Go with a list of topics you want to cover. If there are questions with critical wording, you might want to ask that. But 
7. Keep questions simple. Don't use double-barelled questions because that'll let them 
10. Don't forget the questions you asked. Use those questions you asked, and the recordings there, to drive the story.

Lauren McGaughy, the Dallas Morning News
- practice
- bluff: ask as though you already know
- be a human being. You're allowed to have compassion, and awe, and to cry.
- get out of the office. Don't be afraid to doorknock.
- Questions that work in any interview:
	- Did I get that right?
	- What was that like?
	- How do you know that?
	- Do you have any proof/documentation you want to share with he?
	- Who else should I talk to?
	- Is there something I'm missing here?
	- What has the media gotten wrong about this?
	- Is there anything else you want to talk about? / What else should I have asked?
- double check: better to make an uncomfortable second call than make a correction
- context is key

Tisha Thompson, ESPN
- Smile. Even if the person you're interviewing is a total utter bastard. Don't be the bad cop.
- Read the room: ask about the interesting things in the room.
- Start from the beginning. Walk through the story in the order it happened, from as early as possible.
- Ask too many questions: you want to be factually dead-on, especially with the high-emotion interviews
- Follow up on the things that people mention: request docs, evidence, and so on.
- Be firm but fair. Ask the correct questions.
- Maintain eye contact. Don't stare at your questions.
	- I wonder if how well this works for non-neurotypical reporters or interview subjects.
- Overprepare: be prepared for every possible answer. It's like writing a Choose-your-own Adventure novel.
- Choreograph the interview: know how you'll move.
- Kids are a challenge
	- get to know them and get them comfortable before putting them on the camera.
	- use lavalier mike
	- don't put them in a swivel chair
	- especially have a second camera
