Presenters:
- Rebecca Catalanello, Politifact, wife of Steve Myers and mother, and sometime freelance journalist
- Steve Myers, USA Today, husband of Rebecca Catalanello and father, and some other stuff
- Brittany Renee Mayes, Washington post, 

Rebecca and Steve:
- Rebecca had to drop her job after having a child, after three months' maternal leave. 

Brit:
- had bad work-life balance, did three things to change it:
	- started pole-dancing
	- started a strict work-out regimen to make sure that she was leaving work on time
	- quit old job, found a new job with better work-life balance
- have open and honest communication about needs
- have specific times to work, with set boundaries
- your managers need to take sick leave, vacation, days off. Be an example for for your team. Workplace culture matters! The boss sets an example, in how they work and how they react to their superiors

Rebecca: Had conversation with employer when she was coming off of three-month maternity leave. She wasn't ready for full-time, with her three-month-old's needs. Employer allowed her to come back part-time, ramping up. But that was possible because the team had someone else already, sharing Rebecca's duties.

Steve: At one past job, _everything_ filed through Steve. He was the single point of failure for the newsroom. No work-life balance.

Rebecca: Talk with employer about what the obligations are, while accommodating your personal life. Make them understand that your personal goals outside of work aren't interpreted as a lack of ambition at work.

Steve's preparing his employer and coworkers for when he'll need to start taking more of a parenting role: on these days he'll have a hard stop at a particular time.

Make sure your supervisor understands the amount of time you're actually working and effort you're putting int.

Brittany: Your time is worth just as much as everyone else's. Don't let yourself get dragged into doing things off the clock, letting you start hating job.

## Separating work and personal life

Use different apps for work and personal lives

Use Do Not Disturb.

Schedule emails to send delayed, so that you're not making people receive emails off their hours.

If you can, have a work and personal phones.

> Reminder from @RCatNola: If you are the only person at your organization who can do your job, then people will be more reluctant to let you take time off. Share the load so everyone on your team can hand things off as needed. #nicar20

You don't have to respond to every email immediately. If you respond to even the little things immediately, then you're setting an expectation that you're always available.

Keep a regular schedule so you don't burn out.

## Dealing with when things get out of control

- recognize when things do get out of control
- make time to do the non-work things, like sleep and meals and friendships
- give things end dates
- find goals outside of work and set aside time for them.
