# Doing solo data journalism

https://ireapps.github.io/nicar-2020-schedule#20200307_being_scrappy_doing_data_journalism_as_a_team_of_one_2285

it's never perfect, it's fine

Organization and time management:
- track your FOIAs: tracking numbers, due date/times, 
- track your sources
- track story ideas
- track where you are in a story; every step
- keep a data diary
- schedule a time block per project per day, after which point you stop. Sometimes works.
	- checklists with dates: create a system whereby you can hold yourself accountable and be your own editor
- talk to graphics and artists early in the process

Common solo problems:
- hard to know when to stop researching a story; having todo/check lists helps.
- hard to explain to editors 
	- 
- always short on time

Have people to talk to:
- colleagues who have cone the same sorts of stories:
- independent experts who have worked with the same data
	- find the people who aren't actively trying to be quoted
	- find the ones who care
	- contact them before you need them
	- give them all the data, all your research
	- be transparent
	- let them poke holes in your data
	- be honest and respectful- let them understand your decisions and concerns
- NGOs
- advocacy orgs
- if the city gov isn't friendly, chum up with the auditor's office or the inspector general or IT/data people
- but probably not your sources
