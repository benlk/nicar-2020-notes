# Cheap and Easy Visuals

https://bit.ly/NICAR20Viz

## Infogram

- Graphcs created with it can be posted direct to Twitter/Facebook
- Paid after 10 projects/13 maps. Can be gotten around by deleting old projects, or just creating tons of accounts. Pricing is reasonable.

## Darawrapper

- Very simple, good for evangelizing to the newsroom. Spreadsheet-powered.
- Minimal branding

## Flourish

- "Like a free Datawrapper"
- Data is public unless you pay to keep it private, so you might want to not create the thing until the day before your story posts.

## Tableau Public

- Can hide things that you don't want people to see
- Well-supported, often used in business. Not likely to pull a Google.
- Heavy branding.
- Not responsive to different screen sizes unless you make a specific effort to do it.
- Can build searcheable databases, for free.
- IRE membership includes a benefit for Tableau Pro

## ArcGIS Online

- Great for layering different levels of maps, which were interactive and embeddable.
- Only imports CSV
- Finicky geocoder; requires addresses with zip codes.
- Only 250 rows available in free version
- Lots of open-source data already there, like Census data.
- If you don't have or don't want to give a specific location: Map things to the nearest post office!

## Google Earth Pro

- Good for historical comparisons of satellite imagery.
- Can create flyover and fly-through tours, and export them as an MP4.
- Google asks that you not remove their watermarks, but are otherwise chill.

## Google My Maps

- Good for putting icons on various things in a city
- Part of G Suite, good for nonprofits with free G Suite
- Google's geocoder is nice, doesn't need zip codes

## Adobe Spark

- Easier than squarespace for building a webpage
- Three main features: website buildinger, graphics builder, video exports
- Very templated, but you can import your own fonts and music
- You should not use this for stuff that your video editor will have Opinions about, because it's so templated. Good for social media posts.

## Knight Lab Storytelling Tools

- If you know Google Sheets, you can do stuff
- Customizeable with color and fonts
- Image comparison via sliders
- Tie slides to locations on a map, embedding video and other things
- Timelines

## Weird things:

- Powerpoint: If you have Powerpoint, you can use it to create 2d and 3d animations that can be exported to MP4s
- Paint 3D: installed on new Windows machines. Drag something into Paint 3D, then click "Make 3D"
- Giphy is user-friendly for turning mp4s into gifs, but theat puts the Giphy link and brand on the gif.
- Google Sheets: like Excel but not $$$.
- Microsoft Power BI and Gooogle Data Studio are like Tableau
- Photojoiner and Be Funky are photoshop alternatives.
- Soundcite will put an audio player behind your text
