## Lists of cool tools you can use

From the newsroom open-source tool showcase session:

- Find copy-pasted "model" legislation in your state using Center for Public Integrity's [model legislation tracker](https://model-legislation.apps.publicintegrity.org/)
- [FOIAmail](https://github.com/bettergov/foiamail) handles some of the work of automating large-scale public records requests, using Gmail. It's a rewrite of [FOIA Machine](https://www.foiamachine.org/), and lives in the command-line rather than as some form of GUI. You still have to reply to the responses, however.
- [AutoScrape](https://pypi.org/project/autoscrape/) is a Web interface and Python library for running website scraping jobs. View the demo: https://autoscrape.bxroberts.org/
- [Datashare](https://datashare.icij.org/) from ICIJ is a data-sharing and -analysis tool, for Windows, Mac and Linux.
- If you're using Datashare, check out [Universal Sentence Encoder](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/07/multilingual-universal-sentence-encoder.html), [annoy](https://github.com/spotify/annoy), and which Quartz used to search ICIJ's Luanda Leaks data. IRE will have the slides.
- [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is like iPython/Jupyter notebooks, but running on Google's Cloud. The only downside is that it doesn't have secrets.

IRE's tipsheets will have links for the slides from these presentations.
