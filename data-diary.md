https://ireapps.github.io/nicar-2020-schedule/#20200307_dear_diary_best_practices_for_keeping_a_data_diary_2105_all

What:
- reciep for how to complete your analysis
- recording of every step you take, every decision you make
- reasoning why you took that step
- it's like your interview notes
- for everyone, no matter what tool you use: Excel, SQL, R, Python, whatever
- tracks everything, even as simple as sorting a column

Why:
- allows other people to fact-check your work
- for reporters, a way to show data journos what yypes of analysis you did, and vice versal.
- for readers, a way to capture your methodology. Adds transparency.
- because human memory is bad

Who is the reader?
- You:
	- if you spend a long weekend or have to leave the project for a bit.
	- if it's something updated periodically and you rerun the same analysis every day
- your colleagues
- your boss
- readers
- lawyers
- everyone

What are the formats
- Google Docs
- Text files
- Jupyter or Observable notebooks
- Whatever works for you and is clear to other people

What should it contain?
- your code/formulae
- the StackOverflow links and IRE tipsheets where you found the code
- where you downloaded the data and where you saved it
- text explaining your analysis and why you made certain decisions
- outputs of your code: what it spat out, or links to the files that were the result of the analysis.


It's not just for data journalists. It can be for anyone. Sysadmins. Statisticians. Plumbers.
