## Tips for disaster coverage:

From Laura Moscoso of CPIPR:

Before the disaster:
- Always be requesting the official emergency-reponse plans, from every government agency, at all levels. Go beyond gov: ask the sorts of NGOs that respond to disasters as well. Keep these data requests up to date.
- Ask your sources, even off the record, what the contingency protocols are.
- Have physical maps of hospitals, offices, police. Print off phone numbers.
- Have an emergency response plan for your own newsroom.
- What do you need to have to do your job, without power, water, gas, or Internet? Answering that question is a key part of your plan.

During the disaster:
- Collect official statements.
- Listen to local radio - it's where official statements are distributed, but people also call into local radio.
- Pay attention to local/state/national executive orders that are issued.
- Compose a written timeline of accidents and events near you, and compare it with the official accounts and with the goings-on near you.
- Find the community places where people post missing-persons reports.

After the disaster:
- Check in with coworkers
- Check in with colleagues in other outlets, and check what their view on the event is

How to create your own database:
- Online surveys asking people to report how their loved ones were affected by the disaster. Ask about the circumstances of deaths.
- Request the official death countrs.
