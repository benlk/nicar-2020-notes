Investigating natural disasters: What to do before, during and after

This is notes from the sub-talk by Jeff Adelson, of the Times-Picayune and the New Orleans Advocate.


## Hundred Year Storms

Don't call it a "100-year storm", because while it means that there's a 1% chance of the storm happening in any given year, many people interpret it to mean that these storms come every hundred years.

Hundred-year storms, aka 1% storms, are a term of art created by the National Flood Insurance Program, which provides a way of determining at-risk areas. However, the flood assessments and maps may be out of date to may not take climate change into account. Check when they were updated.

## River flooding

There's multiple sources of river-level data. It makes for nice graphs, and you can compare the predicted river heights with flood preparations like the levees.

## Hurricanes

The National hurricane Center has all the products. They're trying to improve the ways with which they communicate risks. It's not just wind speeds, which drive the categorization of the hurricane. it's rain amounts and storm surge. NHC is creating new forecast products like worst-case inundation risk maps.

Read the maps' documentaton

## Levees

The Corps of Engineers have levees all over the place. They have lots of documentation and data that's available.

The Corps handles risk in a wonky fashion: With levees of the same height on either side of the same river, the farmland side of the river has lower risk than the populated side of the river.

## Story ideas

- Compare FEMA flood-prediction maps with the areas of actual flooding.
- How is the community adapting and making changes to lessen future flood damage? Are people rebuilding in flood zones?
